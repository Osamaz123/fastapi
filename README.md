- Get books by rating: Filter books based on their rating.
- Get books by published date: Find books published in a particular year.
- Create a book: Add a new book to the collection.
- Update a book: Modify the details of an existing book.
- Delete a book: Remove a book from the collection1 by its ID

**Running the application:**

1. Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal:
`pip install requirements.txt`
2. Start the API: Run the main application file using this command:
